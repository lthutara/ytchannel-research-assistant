Already, we have seen developers such as OpenAI and Meta move away from large models to include smaller and less expensive ones, improving AI models to do the same or more using less. Prompt engineering is changing as models such as ChatGPT get more intelligent and better able to understand the nuances of human language. As LLMs are trained on more specific information, they can provide deep expertise for specialized industries, beco"
