# Content Weaver Development TODO

## High Priority
- [ ] **Improve topic selection mechanism** - allow dynamic topic input instead of hardcoded
- [ ] **Increase content depth** - fine-tune prompts for longer, more detailed articles and scripts

## Medium Priority  
- [ ] **Create artifacts in topic-specific directories** (e.g., artifacts/{topic}/sources.json)
- [ ] **Add source transparency** - log which URLs were actually used and their relevance scores

## Low Priority
- [ ] **LangSmith integration** for token optimization and usage tracking

## Git Sync Issues
- [ ] **Verify tests folder** - check if tests/ directory exists and sync with remote
- [ ] **Check git status** for any missing files or sync issues
